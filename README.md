# Git Test

This Godot project is so I can learn how to use Git first and foremost, but also how to use it together with my primary game engine currently, Godot

## Features
* Very basic program so I don't spend much time on this
* Very basic and frequent commits to learn how Git works

For more information, visit the [official Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org).
